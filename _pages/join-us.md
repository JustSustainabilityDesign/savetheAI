This website is in the soft launch phase on occasion of the [Paris AI Action Summit](https://www.elysee.fr/en/sommet-pour-l-action-sur-l-ia) (6–11 February 2025). We are preparing for a full launch this month.

**Please help spread the word**: Snap a photo of any of our posters and postcards you encounter and share it. Use #SavetheAI and tag us on [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/savetheai.bsky.social), [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@savetheai) and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/savetheai/) with @SavetheAI. We have created a share map [here](https://savethe.ai/locations).

**Download and print your own posters, postcards, stickers**. As we roll out new content and place posters, we are sharing them [here](https://savethe.ai/downloads/). Use these posters to inform your surroundings about AI’s footprint. Place them where critical resources are being consumed, such as near water fountains and electrical outlets. All materials will be made available under a Creative Commons license ([CC BY-NC-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/deed.en)). If you would like to help translate them, please do and share them back with us – we will add additional language versions here as they are created.

**Support civil society organizations aiming to limit the impact of AI**: If you agree that we should put humans first, share and support the Green Screen Coalition’s [statement](https://greenscreen.network/en/blog/within-bounds-limiting-ai-environmental-impact/).

**Come back for more: This website is growing.** Want to hear about saving air, jobs, gas and coal for AI? We are working on it! Want to contribute? Please reach out to us on social media or [via email](mailto:savetheainow@proton.me).
