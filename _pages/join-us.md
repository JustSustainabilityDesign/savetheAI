This website is in the soft launch phase on occasion of the Paris AI summit. We are preparing for a full launch during February.

**Please help spread the word**: Snap a photo of any posters and postcards you encounter and share it. Use #SavetheAI and tag us on [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/savetheai.bsky.social), [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@savetheai) and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/savetheai/) with @SavetheAI. We are going to create a share map here.

**Come back for more: This website is growing.** Want to hear about saving air, jobs, gas and coal for AI? We are working on it! Want to contribute? Please reach out on social media or [email](mailto:savetheainow@proton.me).

**Support civil society organizations aiming to limit the impact of AI**

If you agree that we should put humans first, share and support the Green Screen Coalitionâ€™s [statement](https://greenscreen.network/en/blog/within-bounds-limiting-ai-environmental-impact/).
