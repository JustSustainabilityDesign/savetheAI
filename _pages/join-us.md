This website is in the soft launch phase on occasion of the Paris AI summit. We are preparing for a full launch during February.

**Please help spread the word**: Snap a photo of any posters and postcards you encounter and share it. Use #SavetheAI and tag us on [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/savetheai.bsky.social), [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@savetheai) and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/savetheai/) with @SavetheAI. We are going to create a share map here.

**Soon: Download and print your own posters, postcards, stickers**: As we roll out new content and place posters, we are sharing them here. Use these posters to inform your surroundings about AI’s footprint. Place them where critical resources are being consumed, such as near water fountains and electrical outlets. All materials will be Creative Commons ([CC4-BY-SA-NC](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/deed.en). If you’d like to help translate them, please do and share back, we will add additional language versions here.

**Support civil society organizations aiming to limit the impact of AI**: If you agree that we should put humans first, share and support the Green Screen Coalition’s [statement](https://greenscreen.network/en/blog/within-bounds-limiting-ai-environmental-impact/).

**Come back for more: This website is growing.** Want to hear about saving air, jobs, gas and coal for AI? We are working on it! Want to contribute? Please reach out on social media or [email](mailto:savetheainow@proton.me).
