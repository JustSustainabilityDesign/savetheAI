Do we actually want you to sit thirstily in the dark with an empty phone battery? No. 

Our aim with this satirical campaign is to use humor to connect your personal needs for Earth’s resources with the evidence of just how much of those resources are now being claimed for the data centers running generative AI. And to make you smile.

By connecting your thirst with a data center’s cooling system, we address what is sometimes called psychological distance: it is very hard to relate personally to the distant data centers where generative AI models do their work. We normally write about this kind of thing more academically (here and here).

This satirical initiative is created by the Just Sustainability Design Lab, a research group at the University of Toronto dedicated to designing information technology for sustainability and social justice.

This is just the beginning. This website will expand as we uncover AI’s growing demands.
