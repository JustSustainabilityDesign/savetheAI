# AI’s Hidden Water Footprint
Every time you use an AI chatbot like ChatGPT, it consumes water. Using ChatGPT’s latest model, GPT-4: 
- Writing a **100-word email consumes about 500ml of water** (17 oz) [1].
- **10 to 50 queries consume about 2 litres** of water [2].

Additionally, training a model like GPT-3 in Microsoft’s US data centres can consume 5.4 million litres of water [2]. Given that the latest model GPT-4 is larger and more advanced, it’s likely that its numbers are even higher.

The global AI demand in 2027 is projected to require 4.2 and 6.6. billion cubic meters of water withdrawal, surpassing the annual water use of 4 - 6 countries the size of Denmark, or about half of the United Kingdom’s total annual withdrawals [2].

This hidden water cost comes from the infrastructure needed to power and cool AI systems and the manufacturing of chips and servers. What’s more, the water used often has to be drinking quality because impurities can damage the servers [2].

## How AI Uses Water
Understanding AI’s water impact requires distinguishing between water withdrawal and water consumption.

**Water withdrawal:** Freshwater taken from the ground or surface water sources and used temporarily or permanently for industrial purposes. 
**Water consumption:** The amount of water evaporated, transpired, or otherwise removed from the immediate water environment.

**AI’s water footprint spans three main areas:**
On-Site Water for Data Centre Cooling (Scope 1)
- Data centres require cooling systems that often rely on fresh water to manage server heat:
  - **Cooling towers** evaporate water to dissipate heat, with about 80% of water withdrawn is consumed [2].
  - **Air cooling with evaporation** uses water to cool air in hot or dry climates, consuming roughly 70% of the water withdrawn [2]. 
  - **Dry cooling** avoids water use but increases energy consumption, potentially shifting the water burden to electricity generation.
 
Off-Site Water for Electricity Generation (Scope 2)
- Data centers are accountable for off-site water usage associated with electricity consumption. In many countries, thermoelectric power is among the top sectors in terms of water withdrawal and consumption. 
- In the US, **generating electricity withdraws 43.8 liters and consumes 3.1 liters per kWh** on average [2].

Supply Chain Water for Manufacturing (Scope 3)
- Manufacturing AI chips and servers use huge amounts of often ultrapure water, with low recycling rates and potential for toxic waste.
- For example, **Apple reports that 99% of its water footprint comes from its supply chain** [2].

## Key Challenges
**Lack of reporting:** There is no requirement for data centres to report how much water they are consuming [3] [4].

**“Water positive” initiatives:** Companies such as Google and Microsoft claim to be “water positive” by 2030, pledging to return more water than they consume [5] [6]. However, there is little accountability or evidence to support these promises, and water replenishment often happens in different locations than where it was extracted, leaving areas experiencing water stress unresolved [2].

**Carbon-water tradeoffs:** Efforts to reduce carbon emissions are often in conflict with reducing water use [7]. For instance, solar energy in hot periods can increase water needs.

# AI’s Electricity Footprint
Every time you use an AI chatbot like ChatGPT, it uses electricity: 
- **2.9 Wh per search query**, which is the equivalent of 6x-10x the power of a traditional Google search [1].
- **140Wh of energy to write a 100-word email**, equivalent to 7 full charges of an iPhone Pro Max [2].
- 
Additionally, **training ChatGPT-4 consumed over 50 GWh of electricity**, approximately 0.02% of the electricity California generates in a year, and 50x the amount it took to train GPT-3 [3].

The full extent of AI’s electricity consumption stems from a combination of model training, inference, hardware manufacturing, and data centre operations. 

## How AI Uses Electricity
AI depends on vast amounts of energy to function, primarily through **large-scale data centres.**

- **Data centers consume electricity for computing tasks and for their cooling systems.** On average, 40-50% of the energy used by a data center is used for powering the computing equipment, and 30%–40% is dedicated to cooling the equipment [1]. 
- As tech giants race to expand AI capabilities, data centre construction is surging, with **some facilities consuming as much power as a modest-sized city** [4]. 
- Electricity is also used when manufacturing the hardware (e.g., GPUs), as well as for other elements of data center infrastructure (e.g., storage, networking, etc.). **As AI models increase in complexity, they will require more powerful hardware to run them.**

## AI’s Growing Energy Demand
The rapid expansion of AI has led to a surge in data centre construction and electricity consumption, raising concerns about the strain on global energy grids, as well as increasing demands on air, water, labour, fossil fuels, and other critical resources. While AI’s energy footprint continues to grow, long-term concerns include:
- **Straining power grids.** The increased electricity demands of AI are raising concerns about whether energy supply can keep pace. For example, a single Meta data centre in Iowa consumes as much electricity annually as 7 million laptops running 8 hours a day [4]. Further, data centres in the US used about 4.4% of the nation’s power in 2023, and could increase to as much as 12% of US power by 2028 [5]. This rapid increase raises concerns over power grid stability, potentially affecting a wide range of services– including the ability to power your home [6].
- **Increased fossil fuel use.** The high electricity demands of AI-driven data centres are delaying the retirement of coal plants and driving a resurgence in fossil fuel power generation. Coal plants that were scheduled for closure are being kept online to support the power needs of AI infrastructure [4]
