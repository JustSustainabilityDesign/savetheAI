Stay tuned for more poster content coming soon and please find some instructions to help you below. 

**Putting up posters**

1. Download and print our posters from [https://savethe.ai/downloads/](https://savethe.ai/downloads/).
2. Posters are designed to be hung in specific locations, where possible. For example, water usage posters are designed to be hung above water fountains, coffee machines in offices, or other places people typically use drinking water. Try to find a location that fits each poster! 
3. To avoid any potential damage to walls or other surfaces, we suggest using an adhesive putty such as sticky tack to hang posters as opposed to tape. 
4. Once the poster is up, it’s important you **snap a photo of it in its context** to share later on social media. Our online network will help to highlight individual poster locations and create a network of posters around the world. This will help to ensure our campaign reaches as many people as possible. See social media instructions below to ensure the poster location is highlighted.

**Sharing on social media**

1. We are currently on the following social media platforms: [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/savetheai.bsky.social), [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@savetheai) and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/savetheai/). Post to any and all of these platforms.
2. Upload your poster photo, making sure to tag our account handle and our hashtag: #SaveTheAI. We’d also appreciate if you could include a link to our site to redirect others to the important research we’re compiling on the environmental and social effects of AI: savethe.ai
3. Include a mention of the poster’s location - we are featuring a [world map of posters on our site](https://savethe.ai/locations).
4. Add your own message, whether satirical or serious, to personalize your post. Have fun with it!
5. You are now ready to post!
