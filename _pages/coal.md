title: "AI’s Need for Coal"
---
A **10kg (approx. 22lb)** bag of coal could power [^1] approximately:
- **10,000 searches on an AI chatbot** like ChatGPT. [^2]
- **200 emails on an AI chatbot** like ChatGPT, each of 100-words. [^3]

## Coal was being phased out before AI boomed
Coal power plants currently produce about a third of global electricity [^4]. Coal is the **most carbon-intensive of all fossil fuels** however, which has prompted the gradual phasing out of coal for other electricity sources, ideally renewable ones [^5]. AI has directly interrupted the phasing out of coal power plants: 

The energy demand of the United States is predicted to exceed the nation’s power supply in the next few years alone, with data centres being a primary driver of this demand [^6]. 

To meet AI-driven energy demands, coal power plants that were planned to shut down in pursuit of clean energy goals prolonged their deadlines to phase out coal [7].
